# Crude-Oil-and-Natural-Gas-Futures-Data.
A visiual trendline of the movement of crude oil, brent and natural gas through 2024-2025.

Between January 2024 and July 2025, Brent (BZ=F) and WTI(CL=F) futures moved closely together, generally trading within the $65–$85 per barrel range. Both benchmarks peaked in mid-2024 before trending lower into early 2025, followed by a modest recovery through mid-2025.  
  
In contrast, Natural Gas (NG=F)** futures remained much lower, averaging $2–$4 per MMBtu with comparatively modest volatility.  

Overall, oil benchmarks reflected cyclical swings tied to global demand and supply dynamics, while natural gas prices remained subdued over the same period.
